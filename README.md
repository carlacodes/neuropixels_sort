## spike-sorting for 4-shank neuropixels using kilosort4 <br>
n.b. this repository is a work in progress and builds upon my work with Jules Lebert to design an automated spike sorting pipeline for microtungsten and 4-shank Neuropixels probes. <br>
1. install spikeinterface and kilosort4 in a python 3.9 conda environment (via environment.yml) <br>
2. change the relevant parameters in /params <br>
3. run rat_robot_kilosort4.py as a test example
